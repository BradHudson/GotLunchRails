This is the Rails version of the GotLunch app that will replace the sinatra app. The sinatra app attempted to work with dynamo, but some issues have caused me to go with postgresql instead since its easier. I can deploy to heroku easily and use this as my db. The chrome extension will still work as is, but will talk to this app instead.
